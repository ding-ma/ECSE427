# Operating System Class (ECSE 427)

## Docker
We can use docker to set up a remote host in order to compile.
* run `docker-compse up` in the root of this directory
* to connect `ssh user@localhost -p3333` with password `password`
* you can setup a remote toolchain on Clion and compile automatically there


compile `sanityCheck.c` using different tool chains, you should see different name and hostnames.
